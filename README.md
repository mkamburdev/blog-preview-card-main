## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS - CSS preprocessor
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained practical experience with SCSS, which enhanced my understanding of CSS preprocessors and their benefits. I learned how to effectively use variables, nesting, and mixins to write more maintainable and scalable styles.

Moreover, this project allowed me to practice translating a design into code. I learned how to closely follow a given design and ensure that the final product accurately reflects the intended design. This experience has improved my attention to detail and my ability to create pixel-perfect layouts.
